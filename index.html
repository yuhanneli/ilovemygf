Ikaw lang naman kasi ang mamahalin ko. I know you have traumas because of your past, and I am where to give you the treatment you deserve. I would never do such thing. Yung mga promise is nalalaos yan, nawawala, and I don't wanna promise na hindi ako mawawala sa'yo, but isang pangako lang ang kaya kong matupad and that is ikaw lang lagi ang mamahalin ko. Ikaw ang mahal ko sa hirap, sa ginahawa, at sa pahanong hindi na natin alam ang nangyayari sa mundo, Ikaw lang ang aking pipiliin kasi nga diba? I know I said this so many times, but I would never get tired of saying it. Wala na akong pag pipilian pa. Ikaw lang, Mahal ko. Ikaw ang panalo at ikaw lang lagi. Stop overthinking, Alright?

What ever it is, You should know na as long I am walking on this earth, you are never alone. You are never not loved. If I did something to make you feel that way, that I would like to apologize on behalf of my future self.(taena talagang tao yan) Going back. Baby, Sobrang daming tao na nag aalala sa'yo and I'm one of those people. You are loved mahal and hindi ka nag i-isa. Kampi tayo sa lahat, diba? We are literally partners in crime.
